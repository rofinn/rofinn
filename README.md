I'm a software developer and neuroscientist who enjoys working on complex interdisciplinary problems. My academic and vocational experience covers system administration, database management, software development, and research. Previously, I worked at Invenia, where I developed and deployed power grid prediction models. I'm currently learning [React](https://react.dev/learn) / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) while looking for new opportunities. When not learning about new technologies, I ski, hike, and canoe around beautiful British Columbia.
